          My King,

          I still remember the day we met â€” how normal it seemed, how unaware I was of what you would come to mean to me.
          I never imagined that moment would lead me here, writing this letter with a heart so full of love for you.

          At first, I didnâ€™t think much of it. You were kind, you were warm, and then, without even realizing it,
          I started to smile more. Laugh more. Feel more. Slowly, gently, I grew to like you... then love you...
          and now I canâ€™t stop loving you.

          Every moment weâ€™ve shared has become a memory I treasure: the silly and funny ones, the quiet ones,
          the deep conversations, and even the annoying moments. Being with you made me believe in love again â€”
          not just the kind you see in movies, but real love â€” patient, kind, grounding.

          Youâ€™ve shown me that love isnâ€™t always fireworks. Sometimes itâ€™s warmth, comfort, safety... home.

          I find myself always looking forward to being around you â€” to seeing your face, hearing your voice,
          feeling your touch. And every time I leave you, damn!! I feel a quiet ache, like Iâ€™ve left a part of me behind.

          You are special to me in a way I can't fully describe. You're not just someone I love; you're someone I cherish,
          someone I always want to spend time with, someone I thank the universe for every single day.

          Thank you for being you, for being mine, for taking care of me and my heart, and for making every day feel like a beautiful adventure.

          I love you so much AYANFE MI â€” more than Iâ€™ve ever loved anyone. And I will keep loving you in all the quiet ways and loud ways,
          in every version of myself, through every season we walk through together.

          Every moment with you is a gift, and today we celebrate the most amazing person I know.

          I love you forever, MY MAN. ðŸ’Œ

        My King,<br></br>

            I still remember the day we met how normal it seemed, how unaware I was of what you would come to mean to me. <br></br>I never imagined that moment would lead me here, writing this letter with a heart so full of love for you.
            At first,<br></br> I didnâ€™t think much of it. You were kind, you were warm, and then, without even realizing it, I started to smile more.<br></br> Laugh more. Feel more. Slowly, gently, I grew to like you... then love you... and now I canâ€™t stop loving you.<br></br>
            Every moment weâ€™ve shared has become a memory I treasure, the silly and funny ones, the quiet ones, the deep <br></br>conversations, and even the annoying moments. Being with you made me believe in love again. Not just the kind <br></br>you see in movies, but real love, patient, kind, grounding. Youâ€™ve shown me that love isnâ€™t always fireworks.<br></br> Sometimes itâ€™s warmth, comfort, safety... home.
            I find myself always looking forward to being around you, <br></br>to seeing your face, hearing your voice, feeling your touch. And every time I leave you, damn!! i feel a quite ache making <br></br>me feel sick. I feel incomplete, like Iâ€™ve left a part of me behind because in many ways, I have discovered that <br></br>we bond and connect well.
            You are special to me in a way I can't fully describe. You're not just someone I love; <br></br>you're someone I cherish, someone I always want to spend time with and always want in my space,<br></br> someone I thank the universe for every single day.
            I am so grateful for you, for us, and for the love we share. <br></br>Thank you for being you, for being mine, for taking care of me and my Heart and for making every day feel like<br></br> a beautiful adventure.
            I love you so much AYANFE MI, more than Iâ€™ve ever loved anyone.<br></br> And I will keep loving you in all the quiet ways and loud ways, in every version of myself, through every <br></br>season we walk through together.
            Every moment with you is a gift, and today we celebrate the most amazing person I know. <br></br>I love you forever MY MAN. ðŸ’Œ
